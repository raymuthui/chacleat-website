        <h2>Our Clientele</h2>
        <p>
          During every project, we recognize the importance of minimizing
          construction time and anticipating disruptions. Our success in
          managing these factors has been highlighted by the number of repeat
          clients. These have included Government Ministries, Non-governmental
          organizations (NGOs) such as USAID-Kenya, religious missions, public
          and private companies, and local government bodies such as Municipal
          Councils. Furthermore, we provide guarantees for our works and offer
          maintenance services.
